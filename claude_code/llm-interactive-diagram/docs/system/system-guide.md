## System Architecture

The LLM Interactive Diagram is a client-side single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It uses the ReactFlow library for interactive node-based visualizations.

**Architecture Components:**
- Frontend UI (React/TypeScript)
- Visualization Engine (ReactFlow)
- Static Asset Service

As a static web application, it does not require a backend server for core functionality.

## Technology Stack

The application is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+
- **Language**: TypeScript 5+
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6+
- **Visualization Library**: ReactFlow
- **Styling**: CSS with BEM methodology

## Installation Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.0 or later
- **npm**: v8.0 or later
- **Git**: For repository cloning and version control

### Browser Compatibility

The application is compatible with:
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

## Deployment

### Local Development Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd llm-interactive-diagram

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

#### Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# The build artifacts will be in the 'dist' directory
```

#### Hosting Options

The application can be hosted on any static file hosting service:

1. **Traditional Web Server**
   - Copy the contents of the 'dist' directory to your web server's document root

2. **Cloud Hosting Services**
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Google Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN
   - Azure Blob Storage + CDN
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - GitHub Pages

#### Sample Nginx Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name llm-diagram.yourdomain.com;

    root /var/www/llm-interactive-diagram/dist;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Cache static assets
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The application is configured at build time. The main configuration is in the following files:

- `vite.config.ts`: Build configuration
- `src/data/flowData.ts`: Diagram node and edge definitions

### Customizing the Diagram

To add, remove, or modify nodes and connections:

1. Edit the `src/data/flowData.ts` file
2. Update the `initialNodes` array to add/modify nodes
3. Update the `initialEdges` array to add/modify connections
4. Rebuild the application with `npm run build`

## Monitoring and Maintenance

As a static web application, traditional server monitoring isn't required. However, consider implementing:

1. **Frontend Monitoring**
   - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
   - [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking
   - [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com) for session replay and bugs

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
   - [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

## Backup and Recovery

To ensure the application can be restored:

1. **Source Code**
   - Maintain a Git repository with version control
   - Consider GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for repository hosting

2. **Build Artifacts**
   - Store production builds in a secure location
   - Maintain version numbers for each release

## Security Considerations

The application is a static client-side application with minimal security concerns, but consider:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Implement a CSP to prevent XSS attacks
   - Example header:
     ```
     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
     ```

2. **HTTPS**
   - Always serve the application over HTTPS
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies with `npm audit fix`
   - Use `npm outdated` to check for outdated packages

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

**Issue**: `npm run build` fails
**Solution**:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Check for TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- Ensure Node.js version is compatible

### Rendering Issues

**Issue**: Diagram doesn't render correctly
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify that the browser is supported
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Performance Problems

**Issue**: Diagram is slow or unresponsive
**Solution**:
- Reduce the number of nodes and edges in `flowData.ts`
- Optimize images and assets
- Check for memory leaks using browser developer tools

## System Updates

### Update Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Review change logs for new versions
   - Test updates in a development environment
   - Backup current version

2. **Dependency Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   npm update
   
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Fix vulnerabilities
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Application Updates**
   ```bash
   # Pull latest code from repository
   git pull origin main
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy updated build artifacts
   - Verify application functionality
   - Monitor for any issues
