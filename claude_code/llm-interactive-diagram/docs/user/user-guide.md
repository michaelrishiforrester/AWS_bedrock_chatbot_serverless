# LLM Interactive Diagram: User Guide

Welcome to the LLM Interactive Diagram! This educational tool helps you understand the architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and how applications integrate with these technologies.

## Overview

The LLM Interactive Diagram visualizes three main components:

- **LLM Architecture**: The internal components of a Large Language Model (blue nodes)
- **RAG System**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation process (green nodes)
- **Application Integration**: How applications interact with LLMs (purple nodes)

Each component is represented by nodes with connections showing how data flows between them.

## Getting Started

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. You'll see a diagram with colored nodes representing different components
3. The diagram is interactive - you can drag nodes, pan the canvas, and zoom in/out

## Interface Navigation

### Basic Controls

- **Pan**: Click and drag on the empty canvas
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or the zoom controls in the bottom right
- **Reset View**: Click the "Reset Layout" button in the top right

### Node Interaction

- **Move Nodes**: Click and drag any node to reposition it
- **Select Node**: Click on a node to highlight it and its connections
- **Expand Details**: Click the "Show Details" button on any node to see more information
- **Collapse Details**: Click "Hide Details" to collapse the expanded view

## Exploring Node Types

The diagram includes three types of nodes, each with a distinctive color and purpose:

### LLM Architecture Nodes (Blue)

These nodes show the internal components of a Large Language Model:

- **Input Embedding** (üß†): Converts tokens to vector representations
- **Attention Layers** (üîç): Processes contextual relationships between tokens
- **Feed-Forward Networks** (‚öôÔ∏è): Further processes token representations
- **Output Layer** (üì§): Generates token probabilities for next-word prediction

### RAG System Nodes (Green)

These nodes demonstrate how Retrieval-Augmented Generation works:

- **Document Storage** (üìö): Stores the knowledge corpus
- **Embedding Index** (üî¢): Vector database for semantic search
- **Retrieval System** (üîé): Finds relevant context for queries

### Application Integration Nodes (Purple)

These nodes show how applications connect to LLM services:

- **API Gateway** (üîå): Provides access to LLM services
- **Prompt Engineering** (‚úèÔ∏è): Crafts effective instructions for LLMs
- **Response Processing** (üîÑ): Handles and validates LLM outputs

## Understanding Connections

The connections (edges) between nodes represent data flow. Different line styles indicate different types of relationships:

- **Blue lines**: Internal LLM data flow
- **Green lines**: RAG system internal data flow
- **Orange lines**: Application to LLM/RAG connections
- **Purple lines**: Application internal flow
- **Red dashed lines**: Context document flow from RAG to LLM

Hover over connections to see their details, and click on a node to highlight all its connections.

## Interactive Features

### Node Highlighting

When you click on a node, it and its directly connected nodes will be highlighted, while other nodes are dimmed. This helps you focus on specific relationships within the architecture.

### Detail Expansion

Each node contains:
- An icon representing its function
- A title
- A brief description
- A "Show Details" button that reveals in-depth information

The expanded details provide deeper insights into how each component functions.

### Layout Management

If you've moved nodes around and want to return to the original layout, use the "Reset Layout" button in the top-right corner of the diagram.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Diagram appears blank**: Try refreshing the page or check if your browser is up to date
- **Nodes don't drag**: Ensure you're clicking on the node itself and not a button or handle
- **Text overflow**: If text appears cut off, try zooming in or resizing your browser window

### Performance Tips

- For better performance on slower devices, avoid having too many nodes expanded at once
- The minimap in the bottom corner can help you navigate when zoomed in on a large diagram
